# Credit-Card-Detection-Model
## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant challenge in the financial industry, leading to substantial financial losses and security concerns. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based fraud detection system to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. Using a real-world credit card fraud dataset, this model applies advanced data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and supervised learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The project explores various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, comparing their performance in detecting fraud.
## Key Features for this Project
- Data Preprocessing – Handling imbalanced data, feature scaling, and removing anomalies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding transaction patterns and fraud indicators.
- Model Training & Evaluation – Implementing multiple machine learning models and assessing their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimizing model performance using Grid Search and Random Search.
- Deployment Ready – Building a real-time fraud detection system with Flask API integration.
This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of the fraud detection model, including Python code, Jupyter notebooks, and documentation. It serves as a valuable resource for data scientists, financial analysts, and machine learning enthusiasts looking to explore real-world fraud detection use cases.
